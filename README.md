# de_hub
A Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Map based off my School

All you need for to run/compile the map is the [CS:GO - SDK](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Authoring_Tools)

To see updates to this map without the need of the [CS:GO - SDK](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Authoring_Tools) you can go to the #de_hub Channel on my [discord server](https://jyles.club?discord) or [go here](http://discordapp.com/channels/358228594918555658/661482433744732200) if you are in it already (it should open up)

[You can now take a look at the map and experience it with bots (or friends) by subscribing to it on the Steam Community Workshop!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2060554784)
